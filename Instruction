Algorithm 1: The Proactive Detection Strategy-Operations
1. Input: x_0, y_k, C
2. For k = 1 : N
Calculate: y′_k, y^M_k according to (6) and (7) which are Nonlinear transformation and Moving target, respectively
y(bar)k can be obtained by the f(·) and MT remover formulas
x(hat)_k according to state observer formula
r^a_k = y(bar)_k−Cx(bar)_k
If ∥r^a_k∥ ≤r(bar)
flag = 0(Attack-free)
else
flag = 1(Attacked)
End If
End For
3.Output: flag
