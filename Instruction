Algorithm 1: The Proactive Detection Strategy-Operations
1. Input: x0, yk , C
2. For k = 1 : N
Calculate: y′
k , yM
k according to (6) and (7), respectively
¯
yk can be obtained by the f(·) and MT remover
ˆ
xk according to (5)
ra
k = ¯ yk−Cˆ
xk
If ∥ra
k ∥ ≤¯
r
flag = 0(Attack-free)
else
flag = 1(Attacked)
End If
End For
3.Output: flag
